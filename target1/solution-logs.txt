Level one:
    Simple one. Just figure out where the return address is stored on stack, and input a string with the injection address on tail.

Level two:
    Key-point 1: Instructions are coded continuoesly i.e. they don't pad as a 8 byte long code.

    Key-point 2: ret instruction just take whatever poped from the stack as its return address




Level four:
    Not hard, just inject desired gadget address and data onto stack. The key point here is to find these gadgets...just like substring matching with a mache code table as help.
